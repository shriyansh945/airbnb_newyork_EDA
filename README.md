## **Workflow**  

### **1. Data Cleaning**

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
1. **Room Type Distribution**:  
   - Bar charts show that **entire homes/apartments** dominate the market.  

2. **Neighborhood Group Analysis**:  
   - **Manhattan** has the highest average rental prices.  

3. **Availability Trends**:  
   - Heatmaps reveal correlations between `price`, `availability_365`, `reviews`, and `beds`.  

4. **Price Distribution**:  
   - Histograms show most listings fall between **$50-$300**.  

5. **Host Listings**:  
   - Boxplots identify hosts with multiple listings, indicating professional hosting.  

6. **Review Behavior**:
